== README _SortMeSilly_

This is my app 'Sort Me Silly' which uses the Spotify and Echonest APIs

It retrieves all your playlists from Spotify and returns you these values:

- Song name
- Song artist
- Song length
- BPM
- Key
- Energy Level
- Danceability
- Release Date

You can sort or filter, and then resave the new playlist back into your Spotify account.

I'm using the RSpotify ruby client library for Spotify API integration.
